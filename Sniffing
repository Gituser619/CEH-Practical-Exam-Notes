active sniffing
		○ Macof: MAC flooding 
			§ Goal is to force a switch to act as a hub
			$macof -i eth0 -n 10 <optional -d>
				-i	 interface
				-n 	 # of packets
				-d <target>	 destination+
				
		○ Yersinia: DHCP starvation attack 
			$yersinia -I 
				□ Press h for help
				□ Press F2 for DHCP 
				□ Press X for list of attacks
				□ Press 1 for "discover packet which starts starvation attack

		○ Arpspoof: ARP poisoning  
			§ Changes the IP of attacker computer to the IP address of the targets computer
				$arpspoof -i eth0 -t <gateway> <targetip>

		○ Cain & Abel- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack  
			§ Win exe
			§ Cain+abel= password recovery tool that allows the recovery of passwords by sniffing the network and cracking excrpted password
			1. Open cain> and make sure that the IP is correctly set n the configuration tab
			2. Start the sniff proccess
			3. Scan the network-Click the sniffer tab and select the + button
			
		○ TMAC and SMAC- Spoof a MAC address
		○ macchanger- Spoof a MAC address of Linux machine  
			$ifconfi <interface> down
				□ First bring the system's nic down
			$macchanger -s <interface> 
				 show Mac
			$macchaner -r -a <interface>  
				configures a random mac
			$ifconfi <interface> up
			
	2.  network sniffing tools
		○  Wireshark password sniffing  
			1. Filtler the capture with the following 
				http.request.method==POST
			2. Next find the txtpwd string ?????
				Edit> Find Packet> set the thrid box to "string", first box to "packet details", and second box to " Narrow" 

		○ Omnipeek Network Protocol Analyzer - Analyze a network  
		○ SteelCentral Packet Analyzer- Analyze a network
    
	3. Detect network sniffing?????
		Wireshark> Expert info tab
		○ Detect ARP poisoning and promiscuous mode 
			Nmap script
				□  $nmap --script sniff-detect <ip>/<subnet>
        
		○ Capsa Network Analyzer-Detect ARP poisoning
