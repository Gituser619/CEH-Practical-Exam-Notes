Hacking Web Servers
Goal: learn about the server remote access capabilities
		○ Ghost Eye: Info gathering  
			§ Python
			§ Gathers; whois, DNS lookup, EtherApe, NMAP port scan, HTTP header, clickjacking test, robot,txt scan. Link grabber, IP finder, and traceroute 
				$cd ghost_eye
				$python3 ghost_eye.py
					Option>3
					Option>6 = clickjacking
          
		○  Skipfish: web server recon using  (Web server Directory Brute force)
			§ Performs recursive crawl and dictionary based probes
			§ Result is used to access security report
			$skipfish -o <output_report directory> -S /usr/share/skipfish/directories/complete.wl http://< ip>:<port>
				Report can be found in the index.html
				Performs a directory bruteforce method
				□ Finds vulnerability while also including trace
				
		○ httprecon Tool: footprinting a web server 
			§ Win exe
			§ advance banner grabbing, status code enum and header ordering 
			
		○ ID Serve: Footprinting a web server  (identifies server engine)
			§ Win exe
			§ Allows attackers to determine a remote target system application. The type of server 
      
		○ Netcat and Telnet: footprinting a web server 
			§ Netcat- banner grabbing
				$nc -vv  <target> <port>
					>GET / HTTP/1.0
					
			§ Telnet
				$telnet <target> <port>
					>GET / HTTP/1.0
          
		○ Enum web server w/ Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
			§ Script options 
				http-enum	 records(registry, apps)
				hostmap-bfk	
				http.trace	sends HTTP trace request 
				http-waf-detect	 detects web app fw
        
		○ Uniscan: web server fingerprinting(can be used to find directories)****
		Performs simple command while performing dynamic and stress checks on webserver
			$uniscan -u http://<url>:<port>/<folder> -<options below>
				-q	 searches for directories in a server (first step)
				-we	 looks for robots.txt(w) and sitemap.xml(e )
				-d	 obtains Info about email id, source node disclosure, and external host, and web backdoors.
				Reports > /usr/share/uniscan/report
        
 web server attack
		○ Bruteforce credentials using a Dictionary Attack
			1. Find hosts with ftp 
			2. Use a wordlist and hydra to crack the username and passwords
				$hydra -L <userlist.txt> -P <Passlist.txt> <ftp|smb>://<target IP>
